For now, all decisions need to run through me. This is not an elected democracy, but an autocratic dictatorship <img src="https://vic3.paradoxwikis.com/images/f/f1/Law_autocracy.png" width="36"/>

## Team Members <img src="https://vic3.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/6/64/Pop_engineers.png/32px-Pop_engineers.png" width="24"/>
Team Members are contributors, which have added and are continuing to add to the mod. They're given extra rights and access. They also might be heading projects.

## Projects
Projects are specific areas where team members have much more say in what goes. A project might be anything from the translation of a specific language, to certain regions of the map, or broad topics like "artwork"

## Living Document :scroll:

Like so much of this mod, this governance readme is a living document, meaning it is continuously updated and revised to reflect new information, evolving circumstances, or changing needs, rather than being static or final. Especially right now, nothing written here is set in stone and every aspect is open to discussion or revision.

## Funding

As this is currently a 1-person project, I linked my kofi. If things develop and others meaningfully contribute, I will take down.
